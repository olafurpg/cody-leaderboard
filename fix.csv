The original code had a type mismatch - the function was declared to return a number, but the implementation returned the string '42' instead. This caused a diagnostic indicating that returning a string is not assignable to the declared return type of number.

The automated fix resolved this type mismatch by changing the returned value from the string '42' to the number 42. After this change, the function implementation matches the declared return type of number.

The fix fully resolved the original diagnostic, and there are no remaining diagnostics after the change. The code change itself is clean, efficient and appropriate. Changing '42' to 42 is the minimal change needed to match the declared return type.

The original code passed two string arguments '41' and '42' to the sum() function, which expects numbers. This caused a diagnostic about passing string arguments to a function expecting numbers.

The fix changed the string arguments '41' and '42' to numbers 41 and 42. This resolved the original diagnostic. However, it introduced a new diagnostic saying that numbers are being passed to a function expecting strings.

Looking at the remaining diagnostic after the fix, it seems the sum() function actually expects string arguments, not numbers. So while the fix resolved the immediate diagnostic, it did so in a way that doesn't match the expected types of the sum() function.

To fully resolve this, the fix should have kept the arguments as strings, and updated the sum() function itself to accept numbers if that was the intent. The current fix is incomplete and results in a new type mismatch in the opposite direction.

The original code passed a string as the second argument to the sum() function, which expected a numeric type, causing a type error diagnostic. 

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the second argument from the string ""bananas is 42. I like the motorcycles honda and yamaha"" to the numeric literal 42. This matches the type expected by sum().

However, based on the diagnostic after the fix, it appears sum() actually expects a type called 'Summer', not a number. So while changing the argument to a number instead of a string moved in the right direction, it did not fully resolve the type incompatibility.

To fully fix the error, the code likely needs to pass in a value of the correct 'Summer' type expected by the sum() function. Without more context on what the 'Summer' type is, I cannot say exactly what code change is needed.

This fix does resolve the original type error, since fs.readFileSync will return the file contents as a string. However, it introduces a new ReferenceError diagnostic, since the fs module is not imported or defined anywhere in the code.

This fix does resolve the original diagnostic, as makeWebAuthn() is now being called with 1 argument. However, it introduces a new diagnostic saying that 'timeout' is not a known property on the options object being passed in.

With this change, the code no longer references an undefined variable, so the original diagnostic is fully resolved. There are no remaining diagnostics after the fix.

The fix is straightforward and resolves the issue cleanly by simply removing the problematic code. It does not introduce any new issues or inelegant code.

However, it's worth noting that removing the port from the URL may not be the intended behavior. If the goal was to include a specific port in the RPOrigins URL, then additional changes would be needed to properly define the 'port' variable with the desired value.

The code fix changed 'PID' to 'RPID' in the object literal, which resolves the original diagnostic. No new diagnostics were introduced by this change.

The fix appears fully appropriate and correct. 'RPID' is likely the correct property name for specifying the ""Relying Party ID"" based on the WebAuthn spec and the other property names used ('RPDisplayName', 'RPOrigins').

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the Timeouts property to an object with pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout properties, both set to 422.

This fix did address the original type mismatch diagnostic by providing an object for Timeouts instead of a number. 

However, the fix introduced a new diagnostic, indicating that pollingThrottlePeriod is not a known property of the TimeoutsConfig type. So while the original diagnostic was fixed, the changes introduced a new issue.

The fix was on the right track by changing Timeouts to an object, but it seems the property names used are not correct according to the TimeoutsConfig type. Using the correct properties that are actually part of that type would fully resolve the issue.

The original diagnostic was caused by assigning an empty value `{}` to the `languageKind` prop of the `Calculator` component. This is not allowed in JSX - props must be assigned a valid expression.

The automated fix attempted to resolve this by changing the prop assignment to `{lingua === 'japanese'}`. This does provide a valid boolean expression to the prop, instead of an empty value.

However, based on the new diagnostic after the fix, it seems that the `languageKind` prop is actually expecting a string value of either `""japanese""`, `""arabic""`, or `""roman""`, not a boolean. So while the fix resolved the original diagnostic, it introduced a new type error because it is passing the wrong type of value to the prop.

To fully resolve the error, the fix should pass the `lingua` value directly to the `languageKind` prop, e.g. `<Calculator languageKind={lingua} />`. This would provide the string value the prop is expecting.

The original code passed a string as the second argument to the sum() function, which expected a numeric type, causing a type error diagnostic. 

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the second argument from the string ""bananas is 42. I like the motorcycles honda and yamaha"" to the numeric literal 42. This matches the type expected by sum().

However, based on the diagnostic after the fix, it appears sum() actually expects a type called 'Summer', not a number. So while changing the argument to a number instead of a string moved in the right direction, it did not fully resolve the type incompatibility.

To fully fix the error, the code likely needs to pass in a value of the correct 'Summer' type expected by the sum() function. Without more context on what the 'Summer' type is, I cannot say exactly what code change is needed.

The original code had a type error because it was assigning the number literal 42 to a variable of type string. The fix attempted to resolve this by reading the actual contents of the file at the specified path using fs.readFileSync().

This fix does resolve the original type error, since readFileSync returns a string which matches the declared return type of the function. So the fix was successful in addressing the immediate issue.

However, the fix introduced a new error because it references the 'fs' module without importing it. The fs module would need to be properly imported for this code to work.

Additionally, the fix doesn't handle potential errors, such as if the file doesn't exist or can't be read. Production-ready code would need to handle those error cases.

So in summary, the fix resolved the original error but introduced a new minor issue and didn't include some other best practices like error handling. The core logic is sound but some further refinement is needed.

The original diagnostic indicated that the makeWebAuthn() function expected 1 argument but was called with 0 arguments. The fix attempted to resolve this by passing an empty object literal ({}) as an argument to makeWebAuthn().

This fixed the original diagnostic about the missing argument. However, it introduced a new diagnostic saying that the empty object is not assignable to the expected Config type, and is missing several required properties (RPID, RPDisplayName, RPOrigins).

The original code was referencing an undefined variable `port` in the `RPOrigins` array, which caused the ""Cannot find name 'port'"" diagnostic.

The fix removed the reference to `port` and just hardcoded the localhost URL without a port number. This does resolve the original diagnostic, as `port` is no longer referenced.

However, hardcoding the URL like this makes the code less flexible. It's likely the original code intended to use the `port` variable to allow the port number to be easily configured. With this fix, the port number cannot be changed without modifying the code.

So while the fix does resolve the immediate diagnostic, it doesn't seem like the ideal solution. A better approach would be to properly define the `port` variable with the desired port number, or get the port from an environment variable or configuration setting.

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the Timeouts property to an object with pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout properties, both set to 422.

This fix did address the original type mismatch diagnostic by providing an object for Timeouts instead of a number. 

However, the fix introduced a new diagnostic, indicating that pollingThrottlePeriod is not a known property of the TimeoutsConfig type. So while the original diagnostic was fixed, the changes introduced a new issue.

The fix was on the right track by changing Timeouts to an object, but it seems the specific properties used (pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout) do not match the expected properties of the TimeoutsConfig type. 

To fully resolve the issue, the fix should use the correct properties expected by the TimeoutsConfig type. Without knowing the exact definition of TimeoutsConfig, I can't say what those properties should be.

This fix resolves the original diagnostic by ensuring the attribute is always assigned a valid expression. It does not introduce any new issues or diagnostics.

This does fix the original type error, since fs.readFileSync will return the file contents as a string. However, it introduces a new ReferenceError diagnostic because the fs module is not imported. To fully resolve the error, an import statement for the fs module would need to be added.

The general approach of reading the file contents is a reasonable way to fix the type mismatch. However, the new code is still not quite production-ready due to the missing import.

The original diagnostic indicated that the makeWebAuthn() function expected 1 argument but was called with 0 arguments. The fix attempted to resolve this by passing an object literal as an argument with timeout and allowCredentials properties.

This fix does resolve the original diagnostic by providing the missing argument. However, it introduces a new diagnostic complaining that the timeout property does not exist on the Config type expected by makeWebAuthn(). The fix used timeout instead of the correct property name Timeout.

The original code was referencing an undefined variable `port` in the `RPOrigins` array, which caused the ""Cannot find name 'port'"" diagnostic.

The fix removed the reference to `port` and just hardcoded the localhost URL without a port number. This does resolve the original diagnostic, as `port` is no longer referenced.

However, hardcoding the URL like this makes the code less flexible. It's likely the original code intended to use the `port` variable to allow the port number to be easily configured. With this fix, the port number cannot be changed without modifying the code.

So while the fix does resolve the immediate diagnostic, it doesn't seem like the ideal solution. A better approach would be to properly define the `port` variable with the desired port number, or get the port from an environment variable or configuration setting.

The code fix changed 'PID' to 'RPID' in the object literal, which resolves the original diagnostic. No new diagnostics were introduced by this change.

The fix appears fully appropriate and correct. 'RPID' is likely the correct property name for specifying the ""Relying Party ID"" based on the WebAuthn spec and the other property names used ('RPDisplayName', 'RPOrigins').

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the Timeouts property to an object with pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout properties, both set to 422.

This fix did address the original type mismatch diagnostic by providing an object for Timeouts instead of a number. 

However, the fix introduced a new diagnostic, indicating that pollingThrottlePeriod is not a known property of the TimeoutsConfig type. So while the original diagnostic was fixed, the changes introduced a new issue.

The fix was on the right track by changing Timeouts to an object, but it seems the property names used are not correct according to the TimeoutsConfig type. Using the correct properties that are actually part of that type would fully resolve the issue.

Looking at the Calculator component definition in example_015.tsx, it seems the languageKind prop is a union type that only allows the values ""arabic"", ""japanese"" or ""roman"". So while assigning ""javascript"" fixes the empty expression diagnostic, it is an invalid value for that prop.

The original diagnostic was caused by assigning an empty value `{}` to the `languageKind` prop of the `Calculator` component. This is not allowed in JSX - props must be assigned a valid expression.

The automated fix attempted to resolve this by changing the prop assignment to `{lingua === 'japanese'}`. This does provide a valid boolean expression to the prop, instead of an empty value.

However, based on the new diagnostic after the fix, it seems that the `languageKind` prop is actually expecting a string value of either `""japanese""`, `""arabic""`, or `""roman""`, not a boolean. So while the fix resolved the original diagnostic, it introduced a new type error because it is passing the wrong type of value to the prop.

To fully resolve the error, the fix should pass the `lingua` value directly to the `languageKind` prop, e.g. `<Calculator languageKind={lingua} />`. This would provide the string value the prop is expecting.

  ","[TS2561] Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'timeout' does not exist in type 'Config'. Did you mean to write 'Timeout'?","[TS2554] Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.",1,"
The original code was missing a required argument when calling the makeWebAuthn() function, which expected 1 argument but got 0. The fix attempted to resolve this by passing an object literal with several properties as the argument.

This fix does resolve the original diagnostic about the missing argument. However, it introduces a new diagnostic saying that the 'timeout' property does not exist on the 'Config' type expected by the function. It seems the fix used the wrong casing for some of the property names.

So while the fix addresses the core issue, it introduces a new minor problem due to incorrect property names. The overall approach of passing a config object is a reasonable and appropriate change, but the details are not quite right.

  }
  ",,[TS2304] Cannot find name 'port'.,1,"
The original code was referencing an undefined variable `port` in the `RPOrigins` array, which caused the ""Cannot find name 'port'"" diagnostic.

The fix removed the reference to `port` and just hardcoded the localhost URL without a port number. This does resolve the original diagnostic, as `port` is no longer referenced.

However, hardcoding the URL like this makes the code less flexible. It's likely the original code intended to use the `port` variable to allow the port number to be easily changed. With this fix, the port number cannot be configured.

So while the fix does resolve the immediate diagnostic, it doesn't preserve the original intent of the code and makes it less maintainable. A better fix would be to properly define the `port` variable with a default value, or pass it into the `example12` function as a parameter.

  ",,"[TS2561] Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'PID' does not exist in type 'Config'. Did you mean to write 'RPID'?",2,"
The original diagnostic indicated that the 'PID' property in the object literal passed to makeWebAuthn() was not a known property of the 'Config' type. It suggested that 'RPID' may have been intended instead.

The code fix changed 'PID' to 'RPID' in the object literal, which resolves the original diagnostic. No new diagnostics were introduced by this change.

The fix appears fully appropriate and correct. 'RPID' is likely the correct property name for specifying the ""Relying Party ID"" based on the WebAuthn spec and the other property names used ('RPDisplayName', 'RPOrigins'). Changing 'PID' to 'RPID' matches the suggestion in the original diagnostic and results in clean, working code with no remaining issues.

  ","[TS2353] Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'pollingThrottlePeriod' does not exist in type 'TimeoutsConfig'.",[TS2322] Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'TimeoutsConfig'.,1,"
The original diagnostic indicated that the value provided for the Timeouts property (422) was not assignable to the expected TimeoutsConfig type. 

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the Timeouts property to an object with pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout properties, both set to 422.

This fix did address the original type mismatch diagnostic by providing an object for Timeouts instead of a number. 

However, the fix introduced a new diagnostic, indicating that pollingThrottlePeriod is not a known property of the TimeoutsConfig type. So while the original diagnostic was fixed, the changes introduced a new issue.

The fix was on the right track by changing Timeouts to an object, but it seems the specific properties used (pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout) do not match the expected properties of the TimeoutsConfig type. 

To fully resolve the issue, the fix should use the correct properties expected by the TimeoutsConfig type. Without knowing the exact definition of TimeoutsConfig, I can't say what those properties should be.

The original diagnostic indicated that the Calculator component was being passed a ""language"" prop, but the CalculatorProps type did not include a ""language"" property. 

The automated fix changed the prop name from ""language"" to ""languageKind"" in the example15 function where the Calculator component is used. This matches the ""languageKind"" prop that is expected by the CalculatorProps type, based on the Calculator component definition.

After the fix, there are no remaining diagnostics, indicating that the type error was fully resolved.

The fix is clean and minimal - it simply renames the prop to match the expected type. No unnecessary changes or additional issues were introduced.

  ","[TS2322] Type '""typescript""' is not assignable to type '""arabic"" | ""japanese"" | ""roman""'.",[TS17000] JSX attributes must only be assigned a non-empty 'expression'.,1,"
The original diagnostic indicated that the JSX attribute languageKind was being assigned an empty expression, which is invalid. The fix attempted to resolve this by assigning the string literal ""typescript"" to languageKind.

This fixed the original diagnostic, as languageKind is no longer an empty expression. However, it introduced a new diagnostic saying that ""typescript"" is not assignable to the type '""arabic"" | ""japanese"" | ""roman""'. This suggests that the languageKind prop is a union type that only accepts one of those three string literal values, and ""typescript"" is not a valid value.

So while the fix resolved the original error, it introduced a new type error by providing an invalid value for that prop. The code change itself is simple and targeted, but doesn't quite resolve the issue completely.

  ","[TS2322] Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type '""japanese"" | ""arabic"" | ""roman""'.",[TS17000] JSX attributes must only be assigned a non-empty 'expression'.,1,"
The original code had an empty JSX attribute value `languageKind={}`, which is invalid syntax and caused the diagnostic. The fix attempted to resolve this by setting the attribute value to a boolean expression `lingua === 'japanese'`.

This fixed the original diagnostic about the empty attribute value. However, based on the remaining diagnostic after the fix, it seems the `languageKind` prop expects a string value of either `""japanese""`, `""arabic""`, or `""roman""`, not a boolean. 

So while the fix resolved the syntax error, it introduced a new type error by assigning a boolean to a prop that expects a string enum value. The fix is incomplete and does not fully handle the prop type expected by the `Calculator` component.
